# Price_calculator
Price calculator made with Tkinter library
A small tool with basic GUI to help calculate entry prices taking into consideration subsequent and logistic expenses. Made with Python's Tkinter library. I made this tool useful by creating an executable (.exe file) with Pyinstaller that can immediately run without any extra installation.
